Introduction
"Conqueror's Quest" is envisioned as a cooperative real-time strategy (RTS) game, leveraging Three.js for 3D rendering and Colyseus for multiplayer functionality. The game challenges players to collaborate in defeating a powerful AI-controlled opponent within a one-hour match duration, with each player controlling a hero unit, building structures, and recruiting soldiers. This document outlines the high-level design, ensuring a balance between strategic depth, cooperative gameplay, and technical feasibility, given the current time is 03:18 PM EDT on Tuesday, March 11, 2025.
Game Concept and Objectives
The core concept is a 3D RTS where players join a multiplayer session, each controlling their hero unit. They must work together to build bases, gather resources, recruit soldiers, and strategically plan to destroy the AI's main base within the time limit. The game emphasizes cooperation, real-time decision-making, and strategic planning, with secondary objectives like resource collection and mission completion to enhance engagement.
Gameplay Mechanics
The mechanics are designed to provide a rich RTS experience:
Hero Units: Each player has one hero unit with unique abilities and attributes, such as special attacks or buffs. Heroes can be upgraded through experience gained from combat and completing objectives, enhancing their effectiveness in battles.

Buildings: Players can construct various buildings, including bases (central hubs, possibly for hero respawning), resource generators (producing materials and energy over time), barracks (for recruiting soldiers), and defensive structures (towers, walls). Each building requires specific resources and time to construct, with functionalities like resource production, unit recruitment, or defense.

Soldiers: Recruited from barracks, soldiers come in different types (e.g., infantry, archers, cavalry) with varying strengths and weaknesses. Players can command soldiers to perform actions like moving, attacking, or defending, adding strategic depth to unit management.

Resources: The game features two main resources: Materials (for building structures) and Energy (for recruiting and upgrading units). Resources can be gathered from the environment (e.g., mining, harvesting) or generated by specific buildings, requiring players to balance economy and military expansion.

Combat: Real-time combat involves player units (heroes and soldiers) engaging with AI-controlled units and structures. Buildings can be attacked and destroyed, impacting the player's or AI's capabilities, and combat dynamics will need balancing to ensure cooperative play is both challenging and achievable.

Game Flow and Match Structure
The game flow is structured to ensure a smooth and engaging experience:
Lobby/Waiting Room: Players join a game room using Colyseus, waiting for others to join. Once the desired number of players (2-4, for scalability) is reached, the game starts, ensuring cooperative dynamics.

Game Setup: Players are assigned starting positions on the map, provided with initial resources and basic structures (e.g., a small base). The AI sets up its base and initial forces, with predefined or generated layouts for variety.

Gameplay Phase: Players build their bases, gather resources, and recruit soldiers, commanding their hero and units to explore, gather, and engage in combat with AI forces. The AI actively attacks player bases and defends its own, creating dynamic interactions. The match duration is approximately one hour, providing ample time for strategic development.

End of Match: The game ends in two ways: (1) players win by destroying the AI's main base before the timer runs out, or (2) the timer expires, resulting in a loss if the AI's base remains. Players are ranked based on contributions (e.g., damage dealt, buildings constructed), fostering cooperative competition.

User Interface and Interaction
The UI is critical for player engagement and strategy:
Minimap: Positioned in the top left, the minimap provides a 2D overview of the game world, showing player and AI positions for navigation and strategic planning. Players can click on the minimap to move their hero or issue commands to selected units, enhancing usability.

Selection Panel: Displays information about selected units or buildings, such as health, type, and available actions, aiding in decision-making.

Command Panel: Allows players to issue commands to selected units, such as move to a location, attack a target, build a structure, or defend a position, ensuring intuitive control.

Resource Display: Shows current amounts of materials and energy, helping players manage their economy effectively.

Chat: Facilitates communication among players, crucial for coordination in cooperative play, ensuring strategies can be discussed in real-time.

Technical Design
The technical architecture leverages the specified technologies for a robust implementation:
Server-Side (Colyseus)
Room Management: Each game instance is a room in Colyseus, supporting 2-4 players per session for scalability. The server handles player join/leave, ensuring seamless multiplayer interactions.

Game State Synchronization: Colyseus uses a schema-based state synchronization, where the server maintains dynamic data (e.g., positions, health of units, buildings, resource amounts) and syncs it to clients. This ensures consistency across all players, with the server authoritative model reducing cheating risks.

Player Inputs: Clients send commands (e.g., move hero, build structure, attack) to the server, which processes them and updates the game state, maintaining real-time responsiveness.

AI Implementation: The AI is implemented server-side, making decisions based on the current game state. It manages its base, units, and resources, with behaviors like periodic attacks, base defense, and resource management, ensuring a challenging opponent.

Client-Side (Three.js)
3D Rendering: Three.js renders the game world, including terrain, buildings, units, and effects. Entities are represented by 3D models, with optimizations like instancing for multiple units, level of detail (LOD) for distant objects, and occlusion culling for performance. The camera is typically a top-down view with panning and zooming, using OrbitControls or custom systems, allowing players to follow their hero or have a fixed view.

Input Handling: Captures mouse and keyboard inputs for selecting units, giving commands, and navigating the camera, sending these to the server via Colyseus for processing.

UI Management: Manages the minimap, selection panel, command panel, resource display, and chat, ensuring a user-friendly interface. The minimap can be a 2D canvas or orthographic camera view in Three.js, updating in real-time based on server data.

Network Considerations and Scalability
Latency and Synchronization: Colyseus handles state synchronization, ensuring all clients have a consistent view. The server authoritative model minimizes latency issues, with potential strategies like client-side prediction for immediate movement updates to enhance responsiveness.

Scalability: Colyseus is designed for horizontal and vertical scalability, supporting multiple rooms concurrently. Each room can handle 2-4 players, with server performance optimized to manage game logic efficiently, especially with AI and state updates.

AI Design and Difficulty
The AI controls the computer opponent's base, units, and buildings, with decision-making based on simple rules or more complex algorithms. It can:
Periodically send waves of units to attack player bases.

Build additional buildings to produce more units.

Defend its base when under attack.

Target specific player units or buildings based on priority (e.g., resource generators first).

The AI's difficulty can be adjusted through parameters like attack frequency, unit strength, and resource generation, requiring playtesting to balance for cooperative play, ensuring it's challenging but manageable within the one-hour limit.
Performance Considerations
Given the 3D nature and potential for many entities, performance is crucial:
Client-Side: Use instancing for multiple units, LOD for distant objects, and occlusion culling to hide non-visible entities, ensuring smooth rendering. Three.js's capabilities will need optimization, especially with real-time updates from Colyseus.

Server-Side: Efficient game logic implementation is vital, with Colyseus's scalability ensuring multiple rooms can run concurrently without performance degradation. AI logic should be optimized to avoid excessive CPU usage per room.
