This structure keeps server logic (Colyseuss schemas) separate from client rendering (Three.js), with a potential common/ directory for shared constants.
Class Layout
The classes are divided into server-side and client-side, each with specific responsibilities:
Server-Side Classes
GameRoom: Extends Colyseuss's Room class, handling player join/leave, game state management, and game logic updates (e.g., movement, AI decisions).

Entity Schemas: Defined using Colyseuss schemas:
Hero: Properties like position (x, y, z), health, level.

Building: Type (base, barracks, etc.), position, health, resource output.

Soldier: Type, position, health, strength.

PlayerData: Contains hero, list of buildings, soldiers, and resources.

GameState: Map of player IDs to PlayerData.

Client-Side Classes
GameClient: Manages connection to the server and state updates.

SceneManager: Sets up and manages the Three.js scene, camera, and renderer.

Entity Renderers: Classes like HeroRenderer, BuildingRenderer, SoldierRenderer that render entities based on server state.

This layout ensures clear separation of concerns, with the client mirroring server schemas for easier state handling.
General Flow of the Program
The program's flow ensures smooth gameplay and real-time interaction:
Server Setup: The Colyseuss server starts, defining the GameRoom class to initialize the game state. Players joining trigger the creation of their PlayerData, and a tick function updates game logic periodically.

Client Setup: The client loads index.html, initializes the Three.js scene, connects to the server, and renders entities based on the initial game state received.

Gameplay Loop: The server broadcasts state updates (e.g., hero movement, building construction), and the client updates rendered entities accordingly. Players issue commands (e.g., move hero, build) via the UI or minimap, sending them to the server for processing.

AI Behavior: The server-side AI manages its base and units, making decisions like attacking player bases or recruiting soldiers, ensuring dynamic gameplay.

Match End: The game checks if the AI's main base is destroyed or the one-hour timer expires, determining win/loss and notifying players.

This flow leverages server-authoritative state for consistency and client-side rendering for smooth visuals.

Node.js with Colyseuss for multiplayer functionality, managing game rooms, player connections, state synchronization, and AI logic.

The server-authoritative model ensures consistency across clients, reducing cheating risks and maintaining game integrity.

This stack, as of March 11, 2025, leverages mature technologies for a robust implementation, with Three.js supporting WebGL for high-performance rendering and Colyseuss offering scalable room management.
File Structure
The file structure is designed to separate concerns, ensuring clarity and scalability:

project-root/
├── package.json
├── server/
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── gameRoom.js
│   └── entities/
│       ├── hero.js
│       ├── building.js
│       ├── soldier.js
│       ├── playerData.js
│       └── gameState.js
├── client/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css

│       ├── ui.js
│       ├── network.js
│       └── minimap.js
└── common/ (optional for shared utilities)

The server/ directory contains all back-end code, with index.js setting up the Colyseuss server and gameRoom.js defining the game room logic. The entities/ subdirectory holds schema definitions for game entities, ensuring consistency in state management.

The client/ directory includes front-end code, with index.html as the entry point, style.css for UI styling, and main.js for initialization. The three/ subdirectory organizes Three.js-related code, with scene.js for the 3D scene, camera.js for controls, renderer.js for the rendering loop, entities/ for entity renderers, ui.js for interface management, network.js for server communication, and minimap.js for the minimap rendering.

The optional common/ directory can hold shared utilities, such as constants or helper functions, though given Colyseuss's state serialization, it may not be necessary.

This structure, derived from analyzing typical Colyseuss and Three.js project setups, ensures that Cursor AI generates code in the correct directories, preventing organizational errors.
Class Layout
The class layout is divided into server-side and client-side, each with specific responsibilities to maintain separation of concerns:
Server-Side Classes
GameRoom: Extends Colyseuss's Room class, handling player join and leave events, managing the game state, and implementing game logic. Methods include onJoin, onLeave, and a tick function for periodic updates (e.g., movement, AI decisions).

Entity Schemas: Defined using Colyseuss schemas for state synchronization:
Hero: Properties include position (x, y, z), health, level, and abilities, ensuring player-controlled units are tracked.

Building: Includes type (base, barracks, etc.), position, health, and resource output, for structures like resource generators.

Soldier: Includes type, position, health, and strength, for recruited units.

PlayerData: Contains a hero, list of buildings, list of soldiers, and resource amounts (materials, energy), representing each player's state.

GameState: A map of player IDs to PlayerData, maintaining the overall game state for all connected clients.

These schemas, as per Colyseuss documentation, ensure efficient state updates and serialization, critical for multiplayer gameplay.
Client-Side Classes
GameClient: Manages connection to the Colyseuss server, joining the game room, and listening for state updates. It processes incoming data to update local representations, ensuring real-time synchronization.

SceneManager: Sets up and manages the Three.js scene, including camera, renderer, and lighting. It initializes the 3D environment, loading models for heroes, buildings, and soldiers.

Entity Renderers: Classes like HeroRenderer, BuildingRenderer, and SoldierRenderer that create and update Three.js meshes based on server state. For example, HeroRenderer takes a Hero object's position and health to update the corresponding mesh's position and visual state.

CameraControls: Handles camera movement and zooming, using OrbitControls or custom systems, ensuring players can navigate the 3D world effectively.

UIController: Manages the user interface, including the selection panel (showing entity details), command panel (for issuing orders), resource display (materials, energy), and chat for player communication. It also integrates with the minimap for navigation.

MinimapRenderer: Renders the minimap using an orthographic camera in Three.js, displaying a top-down view of the game world as a texture or canvas element in the top left, updating in real-time based on server state.

An unexpected detail is that the client can mirror server schemas by defining classes like Hero on the client side, taking server data to create objects for easier rendering. For example:
javascript

class Hero {
  constructor(data) {
    this.id = data.id;
    this.position = data.position;
    // etc.
  }
}

This approach, not strictly necessary but observed in some projects, enhances code maintainability without affecting gameplay, as the client still relies on server updates.
General Flow of the Program
The program's flow ensures smooth gameplay and real-time interaction, leveraging the server-authoritative model for consistency:
Server Setup: The Colyseuss server starts, defined in server/index.js, setting up the game room using the GameRoom class in gameRoom.js. This class initializes the game state, an instance of GameState schema, containing a map of player IDs to PlayerData. When a player joins, onJoin creates their PlayerData, including a hero, initial resources (e.g., materials: 100, energy: 50), and starting position. A tick function runs periodically (e.g., every 100ms) to update game logic, such as movement interpolation, AI decisions, and combat calculations.

Client Setup: The client loads client/index.html, which initializes the game client in main.js. It connects to the Colyseuss server using network.js, joining the game room and receiving the initial game state. The SceneManager in three/scene.js sets up the Three.js scene, camera, and renderer, loading 3D models for entities. Based on the initial state, EntityRenderers create Three.js meshes for heroes, buildings, and soldiers, rendering them in the scene. The UIController in ui.js sets up the interface, including the minimap in minimap.js using an orthographic camera.

Gameplay Loop: As the game progresses, the server broadcasts state updates (e.g., a hero moved, a building constructed) via Colyseuss, received by the GameClient. The client updates local representations, with EntityRenderers adjusting Three.js meshes' positions, health visuals, etc. Players interact via the UI, selecting entities with mouse clicks (handled by raycasting in Three.js), issuing commands like moving their hero or building structures. These commands are sent to the server via network.js, which processes them and updates the game state, broadcasting changes to all clients.

AI Behavior: The server-side AI, implemented in gameRoom.js, manages its own base and units, making decisions based on the current game state. It can periodically send waves of units to attack player bases, build additional structures, recruit soldiers, and defend its base, with difficulty adjusted through parameters like attack frequency and unit strength. This ensures a challenging opponent, with logic running in the tick function to maintain performance.

Match End: The game checks win conditions in gameRoom.js, determining if the AI's main base is destroyed (win) or the one-hour timer expires (loss). Upon meeting these conditions, the server logs the outcome and notifies clients, which display the result via the UIController. This ensures a clear end to matches, aligning with the game's design for short, engaging sessions.

This flow, derived from analyzing typical multiplayer game architectures, ensures real-time interaction and consistency, with the server authoritative for critical game states to prevent cheating.
Testing and Iteration
To ensure Cursor AI generates code that aligns with this structure, testing is crucial. After each feature implementation, test by analyzing console logs for state updates (e.g., position changes, resource consumption) and taking screenshots for visual verification (e.g., entity rendering, UI updates). Iterate based on these results, refining features to ensure robustness and balance, aligning with the one-hour match duration and cooperative gameplay.
