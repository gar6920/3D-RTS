Testing and Iteration
After each feature, test by analyzing console logs for state updates and taking screenshots to verify visuals. Iterate based on these observations to refine gameplay, ensuring balance and fun within the one-hour match duration.
Survey Note: Detailed Implementation Plan for Cooperative RTS Game Using Three.js and Colyseuss
This document outlines a step-by-step implementation plan for developing a cooperative real-time strategy (RTS) game using Three.js for 3D rendering and Colyseuss for multiplayer functionality. The game features each player controlling a hero unit, building structures, recruiting soldiers, and collaborating to defeat an AI opponent, with matches lasting approximately one hour and including a minimap in the top left. The plan is designed for an AI or developer, such as Cursor AI or Claude, to execute autonomously, testing each feature using console logs and screenshots for iteration.
Introduction
The game, tentatively titled "Conqueror's Quest," aims to deliver an immersive cooperative RTS experience. Given the current date, March 11, 2025, and the technologies specified, the plan leverages the latest features of Three.js for 3D graphics and Colyseuss, which remains a viable multiplayer framework as of recent updates, including version 0.16 with StateView and experimental WebTransport support (Colyseus 0.16 is here! | Colyseus). The implementation is broken into incremental steps, ensuring each feature is testable and iterable based on console logs and visual feedback.
Implementation Plan
The plan consists of 18 steps, each building on the previous, with testing and iteration based on console logs and screenshots. Each step is designed to be implemented and verified independently, ensuring robustness before proceeding.
Step 1: Set Up the Colyseuss Server
Objective: Establish a basic multiplayer server using Colyseuss.

Actions: Install Colyseuss and dependencies, create a room class to handle player connections, and log join/leave events.

Testing: Run the server locally, connect a client, and verify logs show connection events. Check console logs for "Player joined" or "Player left" messages.

Step 2: Define Game State Schemas
Objective: Define the structure for game entities using Colyseuss schemas.

Actions: Create Schema classes for Hero (position, health, level), Building (position, type, health), Soldier (position, type, health), PlayerData (hero, buildings, soldiers, resources), and GameState (players map).

Testing: Log the schema definitions to console, ensuring properties like x, health, and resources are correctly typed. Verify logs show expected schema structure.

Step 3: Implement Player Joining and Leaving
Objective: Handle player connections and disconnections in the room.

Actions: In onJoin, add player data to the game state's players map with initial hero position and resources (e.g., materials: 100, energy: 50). In onLeave, remove player data.

Testing: Join with multiple clients, log player data additions/removals, and take screenshots to verify initial hero positions. Check logs for player counts and resource values.

Step 4: Set Up Client Side with Three.js
Objective: Create a basic 3D scene and connect to the server.

Actions: Set up a Three.js scene with camera, renderer, and lighting. Connect to the Colyseuss server, join the room, and log state updates.

Testing: Run the client, verify a blank 3D scene appears, and check console logs for state updates. Take screenshots to confirm the scene renders correctly.

Step 5: Render Player Heroes
Objective: Display player heroes in the 3D scene.

Actions: Create 3D models for heroes (e.g., spheres), and update their positions based on game state updates.

Testing: Join with multiple players, log hero positions, and take screenshots to verify heroes appear at correct starting positions. Check logs for position updates.

Step 6: Implement Camera Controls
Objective: Enable panning and zooming for the camera.

Actions: Use OrbitControls or custom controls for camera movement, ensuring smooth interaction.

Testing: Pan and zoom the camera, log camera position changes, and take screenshots to verify movement. Check logs for expected position updates.

Step 7: Implement Entity Selection
Objective: Allow players to select entities using mouse clicks.

Actions: Use raycasting to detect clicks on heroes, display selected entity information in a selection panel (e.g., HTML div).

Testing: Click on heroes, log selected entity details (e.g., health, position), and take screenshots to verify panel updates. Check logs for selection events.

Step 8: Implement Movement Commands for Heroes
Objective: Enable players to move their heroes.

Actions: On hero selection and screen/minimap click, send a "moveHero" command to the server with target position.

Testing: Move a hero, log the command sent and server updates, and take screenshots to verify movement. Check logs for position changes over time.

Step 9: Implement Movement Logic on Server
Objective: Handle hero movement on the server.

Actions: Create a tick function (e.g., every 100ms) to update hero positions towards targets, interpolating movement.

Testing: Issue move commands, log position updates in the tick, and take screenshots to verify smooth movement. Check logs for consistent position updates.

Step 10: Implement Minimap
Objective: Create a 2D minimap in the top left.

Actions: Use a canvas or orthographic camera to render a top-down view, showing entity positions as dots. Handle clicks to issue movement commands.

Testing: Log minimap updates, click to move heroes, and take screenshots to verify minimap rendering and functionality. Check logs for command issuance.

Step 11: Add Buildings
Objective: Allow players to build structures.

Actions: Implement a "buildBuilding" command, checking resources and valid locations, starting construction with progress (0-100%).

Testing: Build a base, log resource consumption and progress, and take screenshots to verify building appearance. Check logs for progress updates.

Step 12: Implement Resource Management
Objective: Track and manage player resources.

Actions: Update resources (materials, energy) based on generation and consumption, ensuring sufficient for actions.

Testing: Build and recruit, log resource changes, and take screenshots to verify display. Check logs for resource values.

Step 13: Implement Soldier Recruitment
Objective: Allow recruiting soldiers from buildings.

Actions: Implement "recruitSoldier" command, checking resources and barracks availability, with recruitment progress.

Testing: Recruit soldiers, log progress and resource use, and take screenshots to verify soldier appearance. Check logs for recruitment updates.

Step 14: Implement Basic Combat Mechanics
Objective: Handle unit attacks and damage.

Actions: In the tick, check units within attack range, deal damage, and update health, removing units at zero health.

Testing: Attack with heroes/soldiers, log damage and health changes, and take screenshots to verify combat visuals. Check logs for health updates.

Step 15: Implement AI Opponent
Objective: Set up AI with initial buildings and units.

Actions: Add AI player data, implement decision-making (e.g., build, recruit) in the tick, balancing difficulty.

Testing: Log AI actions (build, recruit), and take screenshots to verify AI entities. Check logs for AI state changes.

Step 16: Implement AI Attacks
Objective: Have AI attack player bases.

Actions: Periodically send AI units to attack, handle combat logic in the tick.

Testing: Observe AI attacks, log attack events, and take screenshots to verify combat. Check logs for AI unit movements.

Step 17: Implement Win Conditions
Objective: Define match end conditions.

Actions: Check if AI's main base is destroyed or timer (one hour) expires, log win/loss.

Testing: Destroy AI base or wait for timer, log outcome, and take screenshots to verify UI. Check logs for end conditions.

Step 18: Refine and Balance
Objective: Ensure gameplay balance and fun.

Actions: Playtest with multiple players, adjust AI difficulty, resource rates, and combat balance based on feedback.

Testing: Log playtest results, take screenshots of gameplay, and iterate based on logs and visuals. Check logs for balance metrics.

Technical Considerations
The plan leverages Colyseuss for state synchronization, ensuring real-time updates, and Three.js for 3D rendering, with optimizations like instancing for multiple units. Performance is critical, especially with many entities, requiring client-side interpolation for smooth movement and server-side tick for game logic updates (Introduction â€“ Colyseus).
Testing and Iteration
Each step requires testing via console logs (e.g., state updates, command execution) and screenshots (e.g., rendering, UI updates). Iteration based on these ensures functionality, with edge cases like player disconnections handled by making inactive heroes AI-controlled temporarily.
